### G'day
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on whatever I feel like working on 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#/.NET programming, but I struggle on committing to learning
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning to code with C#
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to message me through my Discord (it's in my bio), I'm cool I think
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I also like 3d rendering and game design, my favorite genres are strategy and survival or coop.

I've been trying to learn digital skills such as programming, game design and rendering for ages.
I haven't really gone anywhere from it, I'm currently trying to learn C#, for the second time.
Wish me luck.
